Chapter 1. The Machine Learning Landscape

1. How would you define Machine Learning?
  A computer program (machine) learns if its performance on some specific task increases by Experience.

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
  - Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules.
  - Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution.
  - Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
  - Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.

3. What is a labeled training set?
   A training set whose instances have desired solutions. (either class or target depending on the problem at hand (classification/regression))

4.What are the two most common supervised tasks?
  Classification and Regression tasks/problems.

5.Can you name four(4) common unsupervised tasks?
  - Clustering.
  - Dimensionality reduction/ Visualisation.
  - Anomaly/ Novelty detection.
  - Association rule learning.

6.What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
  Reinforcement Learning.

7.What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
  Clustering algortihm.
  
8.Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
  Although spam detection problem can be conventionally framed as a supervised learning problem, -I believe- it can also be framed as an unsupervised learning problem 
  if we don't have a labeled training set. It may also be framed as a semi-supervised learning problem if we have few labeled instances in the given training set.

9.What is an online learning system?
  If a system is trained incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or in small groups it is called an online learning system or   incremental learning system.

10. What is out-of-core learning?
